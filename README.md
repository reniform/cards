# blackstar

`blackstar` (rename pending) is a small application that recreates the engine of a trading card game within a terminal format. It is both a personal project and a learning experience. Inasmuch as it is the travail of a crude beginner, I admit to seeking recourse from AI to whip me into going in the right direction with hints and riddles, and explain, in layman's terms, the source of deftly hidden bugs. However, the architecture, the vision, and the (semi-)rigorous review (as much as I can say in light of my many shortcomings) is all mine.
